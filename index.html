<ti>10.12.2025 ► "without it, one... runs away to find oneself, and finds no one at home" - joan didion</ti> 
<p>
it's so weird to think that running away to find myself is literally worthless. i'm the only "me" out there. i saw a post online saying that you don't find yourself, you build yourself. and it's just so strange that <i>this</i> is me. and this is the only one. like, ever. and everybody else? that's the only one of those to ever exist, <i>ever</i>.
<br><br>
i've felt like i've had so little agency my whole life that trying to think about this is like trying to reason god.
